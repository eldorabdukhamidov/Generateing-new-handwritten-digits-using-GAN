## Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Project From Udacity

## GAN for generating new handwritten digits

In this project, you can be familiar with building a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. If you know how to use a generative adversarial network in your projects, here are other examples to check out:

## Libraries utilized

- **NumPy** - a fundamental package for scientific computing in python
- **Pandas** - an ease-to-use python library for manipulating data structures and performing data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** - a tool that allows the creation of documents with live code
- **Matplotlib** - a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- **PyTorch** - an open source machine learning library
